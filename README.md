##  Why This Project?

Understanding human emotion in real-time has powerful applications in:
- Mental health monitoring
- Adaptive user interfaces
- Sentiment-aware marketing
- Human-computer interaction
- Smart homes or environments

This app brings together **deep learning, computer vision, and real-time interaction** in one compact Streamlit web app.
